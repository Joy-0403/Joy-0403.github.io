    "text": "About Me\nWelcome to my website! My name is Wei Zhou (Joy), and I am currently pursuing the Master of Data Science (MDS) program at the University of British Columbia, with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP).\nBefore graduate school, I worked as a Business Analyst at Nielsen, Didi Global, and Baidu Inc., where I specialized in delivering data analysis and visualization for operations teams. My work involved building dashboards and automated reports, designing experiments and performance metrics, and applying statistical modeling to support decision-making. These efforts helped teams identify growth opportunities, improve operational efficiency, and make data-driven business decisions.\nBeyond academics and work, I am passionate about the outdoors—skiing, camping, and any activity that brings me closer to nature. Time spent outdoors allows me to recharge, slow down, and often sparks new ideas and perspectives.\nI am also a coffee enthusiast. During my time working part-time at Starbucks, I learned how to craft a latte with latte art—a skill I would be delighted to demonstrate someday.\nThis website serves as a space to document my learning journey, showcase my projects, and share insights from my studies. I hope it offers you a deeper understanding of my areas of expertise and interests. Please feel free to explore further and connect with me through the contact information provided."
